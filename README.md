# Data@ANZ Virtual Experience Program

Participated in the Data@ANZ Virtual Experience Program to gain more knowledge of how data is utilised in banks. 

For task 1, I decided to use R instead of data visualisation tools such as Microsoft PowerBI and Tableau to brush up on my R programming skills.

On hindsight, both programming languages and data visualisation tools have pros and cons. R/Python is more flexible, which makes data cleaning much faster. On the other hand, I sorely missed the drag and drop features of visualisation tools, which would come in handy when developing the visualisations.

Feel free to drop any feedback, suggestions/tips are always welcomed :-)
